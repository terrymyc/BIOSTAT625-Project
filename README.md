# Enhancing Missing Data Imputation in Time Series Accelerometry Data

## Project Overview
This project, led by Deji Suolang, Kaidar Nurumov, and Yongchao Ma, focuses on developing and evaluating novel imputation methods for missing time series data in accelerometry studies.
The primary aim is to reduce underreporting bias, thereby enhancing the reliability of wearable device data in health observational and experimental studies.

## Data
The analysis uses data directly from the [Physical Activity and Transit (PAT)](https://www.nyc.gov/site/doh/data/data-sets/physical-activity-and-transit-survey.page) Survey, hosted externally.
The data will not be redistributed through this repository, and scripts will access the data directly from the host website for reproducibility.
